# YAMN Soccer Analytics Project - Instructions for how to set up our project locally 

We are Yuan, Alan, Mark, and Niko, and welcome to our app. YAMN allows you to analyze a variety of football statistics of the big 5 European Leagues + Champions and Europa league, and view analytics of players, teams, and each league as a whole.

Take the following steps to set up web application:

1. Cd into both the client and server folders, and run 'npm install'. This will download any dependencies we need for our application.
2. From both the client and server run 'npm start'. This will start our web application.

Go to "http://localhost:3000/" and view web application. 

Players, Teams, and Leagues in the navbar hold links to those respective pages on our web application. Each page holds a search table that displays the Player, Team, and League databases respectively.
